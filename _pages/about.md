Welcome! I am a third-year PhD student in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Salento (Lecce, Italy) working under the supervision of [Dr. Paola Stefanelli](https://sites.google.com/unisalento.it/paolastefanelli/) and [Prof. Salvatore Siciliano](https://www.unisalento.it/scheda-utente/-/people/salvatore.siciliano).

My research mainly revolves around the study of solutions to the set-theoretical *Yang--Baxter equation* and to the associated set-theoretical *reflection equation*, conducted through the lens of various related algebraic structures - most importantly skew braces (and their generalizations), racks and quandles.
