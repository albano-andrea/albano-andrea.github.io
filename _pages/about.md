Welcome! I am a second-year PhD student in Mathematics and Computer Science working at University of Salento under the supervision of [Dr. Paola Stefanelli](https://sites.google.com/unisalento.it/paolastefanelli/) and [Prof. Salvatore Siciliano](https://www.unisalento.it/scheda-utente/-/people/salvatore.siciliano).

My research mainly revolves around the study of set-theoretical solutions to the *Yang-Baxter equation* and to the associated *reflection equation*, conducted through the lens of various related algebraic structures - such as skew braces (and their generalizations), racks and quandles.
